# TunerTerrace

## Description
This small project was inspired by Radio Garden, a web app and reserach project that allows you to listen to radio stations all around the world. Radio Garden does not have an API. Here, the [pyradios](https://github.com/andreztz/pyradios) and [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are combined to make a Radio Garden-like code-snippet where locations can be queried and a nearby radio station feed will begin playing
